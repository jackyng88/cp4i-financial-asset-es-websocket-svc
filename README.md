# cp4i-financial-websocket-ms project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## What this microservice does
Currently this microservice acts as the last of the financial scenario microservices. It will pull from the Kafka topic and deserializes the JSON into a Java object. The service will then validate if all booleans are false. If so it commits it to a final channel to be used with the WebSocket service.


## Setting the environment variables prior to use

Run the following command and replace the items in <> with your values prior to running the application. Note that the CERT_LOCATION environment variable is only necessary if you need to connect to an Event Streams instance on Cloud Pak for Integration for example.

```shell
export BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=<your-bootstrap-server> \ 
export TOPIC_NAME=<your-topic-name> \
export API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
export CERT_LOCATION=<path-to-truststorefile/es-cert.jks>
```


## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

Note - if you plan to spin up the other Financial project microservices locally you will need to add a -Ddebug=<port> to the above run command as the default puts the local service at port 5005.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using `./mvnw package`.
It produces the `cp4i-financial-websocket-ms-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in the `/target` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/cp4i-financial-websocket-ms-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: `./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`.

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/cp4i-financial-websocket-ms-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`
